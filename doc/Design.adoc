= The Design of Site
Malcolm Sparks <mal@juxt.pro>

== Introduction

=== Notational conventions

`::http` refers to the `juxt.http.alpha` namespace.

`::site` refers to the `juxt.site.alpha` namespace.

`::apex` refers to the `juxt.apex.alpha` namespace.

`::pass` refers to the `juxt.pass.alpha` namespace.

== Design Elements

=== Requests

Requests are Ring requests, expanded with information and context as it
progresses through the processing stages.

====
[source,clojure]
----
{:ring.request/method :get
 :ring.request/path "/index.html"
 ::site.resource …
 ::pass.authorization …}
----
====

Rather than create a new 'context' map, a Ring request map is expanded. To avoid
keyword collisions, the
https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring/blob/2.0/SPEC-2.md[Ring 2.0 namespaced
keywords] are used. The `::site.handler/wrap-ring-1-adapter` wrapper function
adapts incoming and outgoing non-namespaced Ring request and response maps to
their Ring 2.0 equivalents. This function acts as an adapter that may be removed
when used with a Ring 2.0 compatible server.

A benefit of using a single request map throughout the processing stages is that
all information is centralised in this single map. This helps with error
handling, since any error handler has all possible information about the request
for diagnostic purposes.

=== Resources

In Site, Web resources are XT entities.

Since a resource is identified by a URI, we use its URI (or at least its path)
to identify the XT entity too.

[source,clojure]
----
{:xt/id "https://my.site/hello"}
----

The resource's state is stored in the XT entity's attributes, or in other XT
entities it may reference.

[source,clojure]
----
{:xt/id "https://my.site/hello"
 :message-today "Hello World!"}
----

The resource usually has some extra special attributes, defined by our
https://github.com/juxt/spin[spin] library, which provide the resource's
configuration, such as the methods allowed on the resource.

[source,clojure]
----
{:xt/id "https://my.site/hello"
 :message-today "Hello World!"
 :juxt.spin.alpha/methods #{:get :head :options}}
----

TIP: If you want to learn more about resources, see
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-2[Section 2 of RFC 7231].

=== Representations

Representations are Clojure maps. You can either store these as XT entities
too (for example, if the current representations are likely to change
often). But usually, you can store them with the resource's XT entity, shown
in <<ex-hello-world>>.

[[ex-hello-world]]
.Hello World
====

This resource has just one plain-text representation. On this occasion, given
this is a static resource which remains constant, we've chosen to generate its
payload ahead-of-time.

[source,clojure]
----
(alias 'http (create-ns 'juxt.http.alpha))

{:xt/id "https://my.site/hello"
 :message-today "Hello World!"
 ::http/methods #{:get :head :options}
 ::http/representations
 [{::http/content-type "text/plain"
   ::http/content-language "en"
   ::http/content "Hello World!\r\n"
   ::http/content-length 14}]}
----
====

At this stage, don't worry that in the example, the `::http/content` value seems to
duplicate the `:message-today` value in the resource. If we want to allow the
resource's state to change, we can then generate the representation's data from
the resource's state on each web request. _The key thing to remember is that
resources and representations are separate things_.

TIP: If you want to learn more about representations, see
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-3[Section 3 of RFC 7231].

=== Exceptions

Java exceptions are considered cheap enough to throw for any non-OK
response. Clojure's `clojure.lang.ExceptionInfo` is thrown with the request map
given as the `ex-data` argument.

The alternative is to write and maintain convoluted and highly-nested
if/then/else logic.

== Dependencies

The web-layer is supported by some of our modern web libraries:

* https://github.com/juxt/spin[spin] -- A set of supporting functions to model
  web resources and representations as normal Clojure maps, supporting the REST
  architectural style. You can learn more by reading our
  https://www.rest.guide[guide to building RESTful Web APIs].

* https://github.com/juxt/pick[pick] -- A library to negotiate the most
  acceptable representation, if there is more than once to choose from.

* https://github.com/juxt/reap[reap] -- A low-level codec library for HTTP
  headers.

The OpenAPI features are supported by some additional libraries:

* https://github.com/juxt/jinx[jinx] -- A library for JSON Schema validation and
  coercion in Clojure and ClojureScript.
