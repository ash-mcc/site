[bash]
----
# Install any npm controlled libs (probably need to firstly run: shadow-cljs compile app )
npm install

# In a *non-fresh* install, I've used the following to 'force' install stuff...
#     npm install ag-grid-react ag-grid-community
#  or
#     npm init -y

# To make shadow-cljs directly available on to the command line...
#     npm install -g shadow-cljs


# Compile a build once and exit
shadow-cljs compile app

# ! Make sure that dcs-pasi is running on Site before running the webapp

# Compile and watch
shadow-cljs watch app

# Connect to REPL for the build (available while watch is running)
shadow-cljs cljs-repl app

# Running a release build optimized for production use
